# The Great SVG Retcon

Slides for a talk about SVG 2 and how to update web standards without breaking the web.

The talk is currently scheduled to be presented twice:

- [27 September 2016 at CSS Conf in Boston](https://2016.cssconf.com/#speakers)

- [6 October 2016 at the Exchange.js Meetup in Edmonton](http://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/events/233613268/)

[View the slides live on the web](https://ameliabr.github.io/great-svg-retcon/) â€” Warning! Large images, not optimized for web.  Also, the fonts will probably look much less cool if you don't have "Bauhaus 93" on your system.
